This code should be used to generate the astigmatism calibration curve from an acquisition of microspheres coated with fluorophores. It means to convert the localization output file (i.e. the list of coordinates corresponding to all the molecules localized) into a calibration curve for the astigmatism that may be used in subsequent experiments.
